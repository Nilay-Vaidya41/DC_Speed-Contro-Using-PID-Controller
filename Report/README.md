 DC Motor Speed Control Using PID Controller

 Aim
To model a DC motor in MATLAB Simulink and analyze its speed response under open-loop and closed-loop conditions using a PID controller.

 Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink

 Project Description
In this project, a separately excited DC motor is modeled using its electrical and mechanical dynamics. Initially, the motor is simulated in open-loop condition to observe the natural speed response. Due to the limitations of open-loop control, a closed-loop PID controller is implemented to regulate the motor speed.

 Methodology
- Developed DC motor model using electrical and mechanical equations
- Simulated open-loop speed response
- Implemented PID controller for closed-loop control
- Compared open-loop and closed-loop responses

 Results
The open-loop response showed slow speed buildup and dependence on input conditions. After implementing PID control, the motor speed accurately followed the reference value with improved transient response and reduced steady-state error.

 Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of PID control in regulating DC motor speed. Closed-loop control provides better performance and stability compared to open-loop operation.
